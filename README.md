Safari-Battery-Test
===================

This is a small application that allows a user to test the impact on your battery while running Safari on OS 10.

The application will go to the Apple website and BBC website at different intervals and will also clear catch after each visit to simulate a fresh web page load.

Every 60 seconds the battery percentage is logged in a file that will be placed on the destop called Uptimelog.txt.

I will also include a copy of the script so it can be modified if needed.


Thanks!
